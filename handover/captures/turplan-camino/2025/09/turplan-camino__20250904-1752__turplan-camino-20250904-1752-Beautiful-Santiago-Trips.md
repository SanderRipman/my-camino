# 

# Camino de Santiago (Portuguese Way) – ~240 km

# 

# Galicia Wine and Coastal Tour – ~350 km

# 

# Galician Nature and Heritage Tour – ~400 km

# 

# You said:

# Is it normal and allowed to tent/camp along the route

# ChatGPT said:

# Camping along the Camino de Santiago is generally discouraged, as wild camping is restricted in Spain. While it isn't illegal in all regions, local laws often limit where you can pitch a tent, especially in protected natural areas. Additionally, camping may not be allowed in certain municipalities without explicit permission from landowners.

# 

# However, here are some key points:

# 

# Camping in Designated Areas: There are a few official campsites along the Camino routes where you can legally camp.

# 

# Refugios/Albergues: Most pilgrims use albergues (hostels), which are inexpensive and abundant along the route. These are designed specifically for Camino travelers and offer a more comfortable and culturally immersive experience.

# 

# Alternatives: If you're keen on camping, carrying lightweight gear and using official campsites could be an option, though you may need to combine it with stays in albergues or other accommodations.

# 

# In general, it is more convenient to follow the traditional accommodation options unless you're set on camping and willing to research the legalities in each region beforehand.

# 

# You said:

# What is the albergues prices in general?

# ChatGPT said:

# The prices for albergues (hostels for pilgrims) along the Camino de Santiago can vary depending on the type and location, but here are general price ranges:

# 

# Municipal Albergues (run by local authorities):

# 

# Price: Typically €5–€10 per night.

# 

# Basic facilities like shared dormitories, bathrooms, and sometimes a kitchen.

# 

# Private Albergues:

# 

# Price: Usually €10–€15 per night, but sometimes up to €20 in more popular or better-equipped places.

# 

# Often offer more amenities like Wi-Fi, laundry facilities, and meals.

# 

# Donativo Albergues (donation-based, often run by churches or non-profits):

# 

# Price: Donation-based (pay what you can or feel is fair). Donations usually range from €5–€10.

# 

# Basic facilities, and often a communal meal.

# 

# In general, albergues are very affordable, making them the preferred choice for pilgrims on a budget.

# 

# You said:

# Can you give som info regarding the most walked od beautiful Camino Frances trip. How long of a time should I set of

# ChatGPT said:

# The Camino Francés is the most famous and walked route of the Camino de Santiago, known for its cultural richness, social atmosphere, and varied landscapes.

# 

# Camino Francés Overview

# Total Distance: ~780 km

# 

# Start Point: Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port (France)

# 

# End Point: Santiago de Compostela (Spain)

# 

# Terrain: Pyrenees, vineyards, plains, hills, forests, and medieval towns

# 

# Time Needed

# The time you need depends on how much of the route you want to walk:

# 

# 1\. Full Camino Francés (~780 km)

# Recommended time: 30–35 days

# 

# Daily distance: ~20–25 km

# 

# For whom: Healthy, moderately fit individuals who want the full experience

# 

# 2\. Most Popular Section: Sarria to Santiago (~115 km)

# Recommended time: 5–7 days

# 

# Why Sarria? It’s the minimum distance required to earn the Compostela (pilgrim certificate), so it’s very popular

# 

# Scenery: Rolling hills, Galician villages, forest paths – very green and beautiful

# 

# 3\. Mid-Length Section: León to Santiago (~310 km)

# Recommended time: 12–16 days

# 

# Why León? Great balance of city culture, historical sites, and rural walking

# 

# Highlights: Astorga, O Cebreiro (mountain village), and beautiful Galician scenery

# 

# Accommodation

# Albergues are plentiful and well-spaced (every 5–10 km), so no need to book far in advance outside of peak season (July–August).

# 

# Best Time to Go

# September or early October is ideal: fewer crowds than summer, mild weather, and beautiful autumn landscapes.

# 

# Would you like help planning a specific itinerary based on your fitness level and number of days?

# 

# You said:

# Pkt. 3: Is that león in spain or france

# ChatGPT said:

# Great question — the León referred to in point 3 is León, Spain, not France.

# 

# León (Spain) is a historic city on the Camino Francés, located roughly two-thirds of the way to Santiago de Compostela.

# 

# It’s a popular starting point for pilgrims who want a 2-week journey through diverse landscapes, charming villages, and iconic pilgrim towns.

# 

# Let me know if you'd like a sample day-by-day plan from León to Santiago!

# 

# You said:

# Witch airport is most common to fly to, starting the Full camino frances

# ChatGPT said:

# For starting the full Camino Francés in Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port (France), the most common airport options are:

# 

# Most Common Airports:

# Biarritz Airport (BIQ), France

# 

# Closest airport to Saint-Jean (~55 km)

# 

# Small but well-connected to Paris, Lyon, and some European cities

# 

# From Biarritz: Train or bus to Bayonne, then transfer to a local train to Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port

# 

# Pamplona Airport (PNA), Spain

# 

# ~75 km from Saint-Jean

# 

# Fly to Pamplona via Madrid or Barcelona

# 

# From Pamplona: Bus or taxi to Roncesvalles, then taxi or shared shuttle to Saint-Jean

# 

# San Sebastián Airport (EAS), Spain

# 

# Less commonly used, ~85 km away

# 

# Limited international flights, but an option if coming from within Spain

# 

# Bilbao Airport (BIO), Spain

# 

# Larger airport with more international connections (~150 km away)

# 

# Requires train or bus to Pamplona, then to Saint-Jean

# 

# Recommended Route for Most Pilgrims:

# Fly into Paris or Madrid, then:

# 

# From Paris: Take a domestic flight or train to Biarritz or Bayonne

# 

# From Madrid: Fly or take a train to Pamplona, then use ground transport to Saint-Jean

# 

# Would you like help finding the simplest route from your country or city of origin?

# 

# You said:

# Flight landing 26th or 28th of August, would it avoid the crowds? Ec. Not have to book albergue?

# ChatGPT said:

# Landing on August 26th or 28th puts you right at the end of peak season on the Camino Francés, so here's what to expect:

# 

# Crowds \& Booking in Late August:

# Still fairly busy: August is one of the busiest months due to summer holidays in Europe, especially in Spain, France, and Italy.

# 

# Late August: The number of pilgrims begins to decline after around August 20–25, but you'll still encounter moderate-to-high foot traffic, especially in the first week of walking and again during the final 100 km from Sarria.

# 

# Albergue availability:

# 

# Early stages (Saint-Jean to Logroño): Might still require arriving early in the day to secure a bed, especially in smaller towns.

# 

# No need to pre-book municipal albergues, but it helps for private ones if you want peace of mind.

# 

# After the first week: Easier to find beds without booking as pilgrim flow becomes more spread out.

# 

# Tips:

# Start early each morning (6–7 AM) to finish your day by early afternoon — better chance of getting a bed.

# 

# Use apps like Gronze, Buen Camino, or Camino Ninja to check real-time albergue availability and distances.

# 

# If you're carrying a tent as backup (legal at campsites), you'll have peace of mind — but it’s not strictly necessary.

# 

# Would you like a suggestion for a quiet alternative start or staggered itinerary to avoid the heaviest traffic sections?

# 

# You said:

# Is it a lot slower or more expensive if I land in Paris

# ChatGPT said:

# Landing in Paris to start the Camino Francés in Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port is not a lot slower or more expensive, but it does involve a longer transfer than flying into regional airports. Here's a breakdown:

# 

# From Paris to Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port:

# Travel Time:

# TGV (fast train) to Bayonne: ~4–5 hours

# 

# Local train from Bayonne to Saint-Jean: ~1.5–2 hours

# 

# Total travel time: ~6–7 hours (plus transfer time between stations)

# 

# Cost Estimate:

# TGV: €30–€80 (depending on when you book)

# 

# Local train (Bayonne–Saint-Jean): ~€10–€15

# 

# Total cost: ~€40–€100

# 

# Pros:

# Frequent trains

# 

# Comfortable, scenic journey

# 

# Often cheaper flights into Paris vs. regional airports like Biarritz or Pamplona

# 

# Cons:

# Longer overall travel day after landing

# 

# Requires a transfer from Paris CDG Airport to Montparnasse station (~1 hour by RER train)

# 

# Comparison to Regional Airports:

# Flying to Biarritz: Faster access to Saint-Jean (~2–3 hours total), but fewer flights and often higher airfare.

# 

# Flying to Pamplona: Requires a taxi or multi-leg trip to Saint-Jean; also slightly more expensive overall.

# 

# Verdict:

# Landing in Paris is perfectly reasonable and often a good budget choice, especially if you:

#

#

# 

# Want help planning the exact route from CDG to Saint-Jean, step by step?

# 

# You said:

# When in sep/oct does the high season start to wear off, consideringthe route im walking. I want to avoid having to book the albergue in advance

# ChatGPT said:

# For the Camino Francés, especially the sections starting from Sarria (which is the most popular starting point for many pilgrims), the high season tends to start to wear off around mid-September. Here’s a more detailed breakdown of what to expect during September and October:

# 

# High Season Overview (July – Mid-September)

# Peak pilgrim traffic: The route is busy, especially the last 100 km (from Sarria to Santiago), which is when many pilgrims begin. This part of the Camino is particularly crowded, and advance bookings for albergues are often recommended.

# 

# Accommodation: While there are plenty of albergues along the way, finding a bed without booking in advance can be more challenging, especially during the first part of September.

# 

# Mid-September (After 15th September)

# Transition: The crowds start to thin out. The peak of summer holidays is over, and the weather is still pleasant, though cooler.

# 

# Accommodation: No need to book in advance, though it’s still a good idea to arrive early in the day, especially in the popular towns (like Sarria, Portomarín, and Palas de Rei).

# 

# Weather: Temperatures are cooler, which makes for a more comfortable walking experience.

# 

# October (1st – 15th October)

# Lower Crowds: By the beginning of October, the crowds have significantly decreased, especially after the first week of the month. This is when many pilgrims opt for a quieter experience.

# 

# Accommodation: You can expect much less pressure on albergues. It’s possible to walk without advance bookings, but arriving early (before 2–3 PM) is still recommended for the best chance of a bed.

# 

# Weather: October offers crisp, cooler temperatures and often autumn foliage, making it a beautiful time for walking.

# 

# Late October (Mid to Late October)

# Very Quiet: By mid to late October, the number of pilgrims drops significantly. Albergues will be quieter, and there will be far fewer people on the trail.

# 

# Accommodation: Very few pilgrims will require advance bookings. However, some albergues may be closed by the end of October for the off-season, especially private ones.

# 

# Weather: It can be cooler and rainier, but still manageable for those well-prepared.

# 

# Summary:

# Mid-September marks the beginning of the low season where the crowds begin to thin out. This is the sweet spot if you want to avoid booking albergues in advance and still enjoy comfortable walking conditions.

# 

# October offers a quieter and more relaxed experience with even fewer pilgrims, especially later in the month. However, do keep in mind that some albergues may close towards the end of the month.

# 

# Recommendation:

# If you want to avoid the crowds and the need for advance bookings, starting in mid-September is ideal. You'll have a balance of good weather and fewer pilgrims, and you’ll be able to enjoy the experience with a more peaceful atmosphere.

# 

# Would you like more details about the specific sections or albergue availability for these months?

# 

# You said:

# So if I start e.g. 10th of sep, I shouldn't expect overcrowded albergue, considering highest traffic is toward the end, and I'm walking for around 30 days?

# ChatGPT said:

# Correct — starting the Camino Francés around September 10th is actually a smart choice if your goal is to avoid overcrowded albergues, especially considering:

# 

# ✅ Why It Works:

# 1\. Crowds Begin to Decrease Mid-September

# You're catching the tail end of the high season.

# 

# While the route will still be pleasantly social, the intense rush from July–early September will be winding down.

# 

# You’ll likely have a calmer experience overall, especially in the earlier (longer) stages where fewer pilgrims walk the full Camino.

# 

# 2\. Most Crowds Concentrated in Final 100 km (Sarria → Santiago)

# That section is very busy year-round, but if you reach it in early to mid-October, the pressure will be much lower.

# 

# Starting Sep 10 and walking ~30–35 days means you’ll reach Sarria around Oct 10–15, which is post-peak.

# 

# 3\. Weather Still Ideal

# You’ll enjoy mild to warm weather in mid-September, gradually cooling into autumn.

# 

# October has crisp mornings and beautiful fall scenery, but is still very walkable if you're reasonably prepared (light rain gear, layers).

# 

# 4\. Albergue Availability

# In mid-September, albergues are still fully operational, but without full capacity pressure.

# 

# From late September onward, you rarely need to book in advance, especially if you start walking early each day (most pilgrims aim to arrive by 2–3 PM).

# 

# 📌 Recommendation:

# Start Date: Sep 9–12 is ideal.

# 

# Route: Full Camino Francés (~780 km)

# 

# Pace: 25–28 km/day is standard for fit walkers → you’ll reach Santiago in ~30–33 days

# 

# Arrival in Santiago: Around October 10–15, just as everything quiets down.

# 

# Would you like a sample day-by-day plan for a 30- to 33-day itinerary starting on September 10?

# 

# You said:

# Can you search for cheap and good flight tickets for me around that time? Departure from Alicante, Spain to the start of camino frances. At arrival in Santiago, my destination will be Norway, Bergen. I don't mind transfer, and very flexible on date. As long as there is 30-36 days in between, you can be flexible to find the best price vs travel time combo

# ChatGPT said:

# Here are the best travel options based on your criteria—departing Alicante for the start of the Camino in mid-September, then returning from Santiago de Compostela to Bergen 30–36 days later. The goal is the optimal balance of price, ground travel time, and flight convenience:

# Error while searching

# You said:

# If I land 16sep 07:50am in Bilbao and flying from Santiago De Composela 19okt 13:30, would i have sufficient time for walking the camino? Take into account travel time to both the start and from the end of the trip

# ChatGPT said:

# Yes – landing in Bilbao on September 16 at 07:50 and flying out of Santiago de Compostela on October 19 at 13:30 gives you plenty of time to complete the full Camino Francés from Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port to Santiago, including travel to and from the trail.

# 

# ✅ Breakdown of Your Available Time:

# Arrival in Bilbao: 07:50 on Sept 16

# 

# Estimated ground travel to Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port:

# 

# ~2.5 hours bus/train from Bilbao to Bayonne

# 

# ~1.5 hours train from Bayonne to SJPdP

# 

# Total: ~5–6 hours

# 

# You can arrive in Saint-Jean the same day, especially if you catch an early bus/train.

# 

# ➡️ Camino start possible on Sept 17 morning (if you stay the night in SJPdP)

# 

# Departure from Santiago: Oct 19 at 13:30

# 

# Ideally arrive in Santiago by Oct 18

# 

# This gives you time for:

# 

# Final pilgrim office check-in

# 

# Cathedral visit and certificate (Compostela)

# 

# Relax before flight

# 

# 📅 Time for Walking

# Sept 17 to Oct 18 = 32 full walking days

# 

# Camino Francés length: ~780 km

# 

# Average pace needed: ~24–25 km/day

# 

# Very reasonable for fit, healthy walkers

# 

# Includes flexibility for one or two light or rest days

# 

# 🧭 Conclusion

# Yes, your proposed schedule is excellent:

# 

# Item	Date

# Land in Bilbao	Sept 16 @ 07:50

# Arrive in SJPdP	Evening Sept 16

# Start walking	Sept 17

# Arrive Santiago	~Oct 17–18

# Fly home	Oct 19 @ 13:30

# You’ll have enough time, travel buffers, and some flexibility for short days or rest. Want a suggested day-by-day itinerary or help booking the exact transport connections from Bilbao to SJPdP?

# 

# You said:

# Is that the common trip time people (32 walking days) account for? If i'm ahead og time, i might consider walking to the "end of the world" (ca. 90 km on way) as well

# ChatGPT said:

# Yes, 32 walking days is very typical and aligns well with what many pilgrims plan for the full Camino Francés (Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port to Santiago de Compostela).

# 

# 🥾 Average Walking Time (Full Camino Francés ~780 km)

# Pace	Days Needed

# Leisure (20 km/day)	~38–40 days

# Moderate (24–26 km/day)	~30–33 days ✅

# Fast (28–32 km/day)	~26–28 days

# So at 32 walking days, you're right in the normal range for a moderate pace with:

# 

# Enough time to enjoy towns and take short days when needed

# 

# Flexibility to stay in unique albergues, attend pilgrim masses, etc.

# 

# 🧭 Bonus Walk: Santiago → Finisterre ("End of the World")

# Distance: ~90 km (Santiago → Finisterre)

# 

# Usual time: 3–4 days walking

# 

# Optional extension: Continue from Finisterre to Muxía (additional ~30 km)

# 

# ✅ If you finish in 28–30 days, you’ll likely have 2–4 days available to walk to Finisterre and still make your Oct 19 return flight.

# 

# 🧳 Recommendation:

# Plan your Camino with some flexibility:

# 

# If you're on schedule or ahead, you can walk to Finisterre

# 

# If you're delayed or tired, you can use the last few days to enjoy Santiago or take a bus to Finisterre

# 

# Would you like a hybrid itinerary that includes optional Finisterre extension if you're ahead of schedule?

# 💡 Tips for bruk

# Kopier koden nøyaktig og lim den inn i feltet “Do you have a promo code?” i bestillingsprosessen.

# 

# Sjekk vilkår – noen koder krever minimumspris eller gjelder kun for visse destinasjoner og billettype.

# 

# Test flere koder – velg den fremste etter rabatt‑prosenten, men sjekk også om prisgrensen oppfylles.

# 

# Betalingstype – koder som VUELING‑VISA og PAYPAL15 krever spesifikk betalingsmetode.

# 

# Bruk mobil-appen – enkelte koder fungerer kun via Vueling-appen.

# 

# ✅ Forslag:

# Prøv først LOVE20 eller CYBERVY for maksimal rabatt.

# 

# Hvis ikke gyldig, test deretter VUELING18, VUELING‑VISA, eller PAYPAL15, avhengig av betalingsmåte.

# 

# Sjekk at koden gjelder for de valgte datoene og den ruten du booker.

# 🚍 Steg 1: Bilbao → Bayonne (buss, f.eks. ALSA, Flixbus eller BlaBlaCar Bus)

# Estimert reisetid: ~2.5–3 timer

#

# ✅ Oppsummert anbefaling

# Velg bussavgang fra Bilbao rundt 11:30–12:30 for å komme deg til Bayonne i god tid.

# 

# Deretter ta toget rundt 15:00 mot SJPdP — du ankommer før kvelden.

# 

# Fordelene: lav pris (~€15 totalt), enkel reiseplan som gjenspeiler ankomsttiden din, og god margin til start på Caminoen dagen etter.

# 

# Gi beskjed om du ønsker direkte bookinglenker for en spesifikk avgang på 13. september 😊

# 

# You said:

# Ja takk, etter dine anbefalinger. Men først, er det slik med buss og tog at jeg kan hoppe på et tidligere hvis jeg rekker, eller er man fast til tidspunkt når man booker?

# ChatGPT said:

# Veldig godt spørsmål – her er hvordan det vanligvis fungerer for buss og tog i Spania og Frankrike, spesielt på ruten Bilbao → Bayonne → Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port:

# 

# 🚌 Buss (Bilbao → Bayonne)

# ✅ Du er som regel bundet til avgangstid

# FlixBus / ALSA / BlaBlaCar Bus: Billetten gjelder for den spesifikke avgangen du har kjøpt.

# 

# Hvis du kommer for tidlig: Du kan ikke bare hoppe på en tidligere avgang uten å endre billetten via app eller nettside (ofte mot gebyr).

# 

# Endring mulig: Noen selskaper lar deg endre tidspunkt opp til kort tid før avgang, men dette avhenger av billettype.

# 

# 🟡 Tips: Velg en buss med god margin etter flyankomst – heller litt ventetid enn stress.

# 

# 🚆 Tog (Bayonne → Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port)

# 🚥 Litt mer fleksibelt – men avhenger av billettype

# SNCF TER (lokaltog): Mange billetter er "open ticket" eller gjelder for valgt dag, men:

# 

# Hvis du kjøper en spesifikk avgang (f.eks. kl. 15:02), billetten gjelder vanligvis kun for det toget.

# 

# Hvis du kjøper i billettautomat på stasjonen, kan det være mer fleksibelt.

# 

# Ingen setereservasjon på disse togene – så du kan i praksis prøve deg på et tidligere tog, men det er ikke garantert tillatt med mindre billetten dekker det.

# 

# 🟡 Tips: Ved kjøp via SNCF Connect eller Trainline, se etter om det står “Flexible” eller “Valable toute la journée”.

# 

# ✅ Anbefalinger ut fra din plan

# Buss (Bilbao → Bayonne): Bestill en avgang rundt kl. 11:30–12:30.

# Det gir:

# 

# God margin fra flyet ditt (ankomst kl. 10:05)

# 

# Lite stress ved evt. bagasje eller forsinkelser

# 

# Tog (Bayonne → SJPdP):

# 

# Vent med å kjøpe til du er fremme i Bayonne hvis du vil ha fleksibilitet

# 

# Ellers, kjøp en billett til f.eks. 15:00-toget, og hold deg til det

# 

# Ønsker du nå at jeg finner:

# 

# En konkret bussavgang Bilbao → Bayonne (f.eks. kl. 12:00)

# 

# Et konkret tog Bayonne → SJPdP (f.eks. kl. 15:02)

# 

# …med direkte lenker til billettkjøp?

# 

# You said:

# Er det kort fra bussholdeplass ved ankomst til tog? Går det alternativt et tidligere tog jeg kan rekke?

# ChatGPT said:

# Her er svar på spørsmålene dine, basert på rutetilbudet fra Bilbao til Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port:

# 

# ⚠️ Kort reiseoversikt

# Flyet ditt lander kl. 10:05 i Bilbao. Deretter tar du buss og tog via Bayonne videre til Saint‑Jean‑Pied‑de‑Port samme dag.

# 

# Bilbao Intermodal bussterminal (din bussavgang) ligger direkte under San Mamés tog- og metro-stasjon, så busstasjonen og togstasjonen er i praksis én enhet med kort gangavstand (ofte under 5 min)

# ✅ Flexibilitet med tog?

# Det kan være mulig å ta et tidligere tog enn den du har bestilt, spesielt om billetten er kjøpt som “open ticket” eller uten spesifisert avganger. MEN hvis du kjøper til én bestemt togavgang, gjelder den. Billettkjøp ved stasjon (automat) gir ofte mer fleksibilitet.

# 

# 📌 Eksempelplan anbefalt

# Flyankomst: Bilbao 10:05

# 

# Busstasjon (Bilbao Intermodal): rett ved San Mamés togstasjon

# 

# Busstopp: f.eks. buss kl. 11:30 (du ankommer Bayonne rundt 13:50)

# 

# Togavgang fra Bayonne: rundt kl. 15:00 som ankommer St‑Jean rundt 16:05

# 

# ⌛ Kort gåavstand mellom bussholdeplass og togstasjon i Bayonne – vanligvis ved samme stasjon, minimal transfertid

# ✔️ Oppsummert svar

# Kan du hoppe på en tidligere buss?

# Nei – bussbillett gjelder kun for valgt avgang. Du kan endre tidspunkt hvis billettype tillater det, men ikke hoppe på en tidligere buss uten oppgradering.

# 

# Er buss- og togholdeplass nær hverandre?

# Ja – i både Bilbao og Bayonne er det kort avstand mellom terminalene. I Bilbao er bussterminal og San Mamés togstasjon integrert. I Bayonne er avgang og ankomst til tog og busstasjon samme kompleks

# You said:

# Hvor høy stigning er det første dag av camino (Pyreneene)

# ChatGPT said:

# Første dag på Camino Francés fra Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port til Roncesvalles er kjent som den mest krevende etappen på hele ruta, hovedsakelig på grunn av høy stigning over Pyreneene – men også som en av de vakreste.

# 

# 📍 Etappe: Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port → Roncesvalles

# Lengde: ca. 24–27 km (avhengig av valgt rute)

# 

# Stigning (elevasjon gain):

# 

# ↑ 1200–1400 høydemeter (meter stigning)

# 

# ↓ ca. 500–600 høydemeter nedstigning

# 

# Høyeste punkt: Col de Lepoeder – ca. 1450 moh

# 

# Startpunkt: Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port – ca. 170 moh

# 

# Netto klatring: ca. +1.250 meter

# 

# 🧭 Rutealternativer:

# 1\. Napoleonsruten (hovedruten / panoramaruten)

# Mer krevende, men spektakulær

# 

# Stengt om vinteren (vanligvis mellom 1. nov og 31. mars)

# 

# Total stigning: ca. 1.350 høydemeter

# 

# Anbefalt ved godt vær og fysisk form

# 

# 2\. Valcarlos-ruten (lavlandsrute)

# Går via asfalt og skogsområder

# 

# Mer skånsom ved dårlig vær og vinter

# 

# Total stigning: ca. 800–1000 høydemeter, men mer opp og ned

# 

# Mindre spektakulær, men tryggere i regn eller tåke

# 

# ⏱️ Tid å beregne

# Gjennomsnittlig gangtid:

# 

# Napoleonsruten: 7–9 timer

# 

# Valcarlosruten: 7–8 timer

# 

# Vanskelighetsgrad: Høy (særlig første 2/3)

# 

# 🎒 Tips for første etappe

# Start tidlig (før kl. 08:00)

# 

# Ta nok vann og mat – få muligheter før Roncesvalles

# 

# Vurder å dele opp ruten ved å overnatte i Orisson (8 km, 800 moh), spesielt om du har tung sekk eller vil ta det rolig

# 

# ✅ Oppsummert

# Fra	Til	Distanse	Stigning	Maks høyde	Anbefalt tid

# SJPdP	Roncesvalles	24–27 km	+1200–1400 m	1450 moh	7–9 timer

# Ønsker du høydeprofil eller kart med stigningskurve i PDF eller som bilde?

# You said:

# Hva klær og temperatur kan jeg forvente på denne dagen?

# ChatGPT said:

# Når du starter Caminoen over Pyreneene fra Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port til Roncesvalles i midt-september (f.eks. 14. september), kan været variere betydelig gjennom dagen og med høyden. Her er hva du realistisk kan forvente og bør ha på deg:

# 

# 🌡️ Forventede temperaturer i midten av september

# Sted	Morgen (kl. 07–09)	Ettermiddag (kl. 14–17)	Høyde

# Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port	10–14 °C	18–22 °C	170 moh

# Col de Lepoeder (toppen)	4–10 °C	10–16 °C	1450 moh

# Roncesvalles	7–12 °C	15–19 °C	950 moh

# 🌧️ Det kan være tåke, regn eller kraftig vind selv på varme dager pga. høyden – været skifter raskt.

# 

# 👕 Anbefalte klær (lag-på-lag) for første etappe

# 🎒 På deg fra start:

# Teknisk t-skjorte (syntetisk eller merinoull)

# 

# Langermet ulltrøye eller tynn fleece

# 

# Lett vindtett/vanntett jakke (Gore-Tex e.l.)

# 

# Tynne turbukser eller zip-off shorts (vindavvisende)

# 

# 🧤 I sekken (bruk etter behov):

# Dunjakke eller tykkere fleece til bruk på toppen om det blåser

# 

# Regnbukse hvis det er varslet regn

# 

# Lue og hansker (det kan være ned mot 4–6 °C og vind)

# 

# Skiftetrøye og ekstra sokker

# 

# Solhatt/caps og solbriller – sola kan være sterk i høyden

# 

# 👣 Sko og annet utstyr:

# Lette fjellstøvler eller solide tursko med godt grep (spesielt viktig i nedstigningen til Roncesvalles)

# 

# Staver anbefales (letter trykk på knærne og gir støtte i bratte partier)

# 

# Minst 2 liter vann og energimat (det finnes ingen butikker på veien med mindre du stopper i Orisson)

# 

# ✅ Kort oppsummert pakkeforslag for dagen:

# 🔼 Klær for både 15–20 °C og 4–10 °C

# 

# 🧢 Hodeplagg for både sol og kulde

# 

# 🌧 Regn- og vindtett ytterlag

# 

# 🥾 Gode sko og staver

# 

# 🧤 Liten sekk med fleksibelt lag-på-lag

# 

# Vil du ha en detaljert pakkeliste bare for denne etappen, eller forslag til minimalistisk Camino-pakking for hele turen med høst i Nord-Spania?

# 

# You said:

# Med trent normalt tempo når på dagen bør jeg begynne å gå, for å få best vær/temperatur på oppstigning/topp?

# ChatGPT said:

# Godt spørsmål – tidspunktet du starter på første dag over Pyreneene har stor innvirkning på både vær, temperatur og trygghet. Her er hva du bør vite:

# 

# 🎯 Mål:

# Å nå toppen (Col de Lepoeder, 1450 moh) før:

# 

# den kraftigste solen (kl. 12–14), hvis det er varmt

# 

# eller før eventuell ettermiddagståke/regn trekker inn, som skjer ofte i høyden

# 

# ✅ Anbefalt starttidspunkt

# Starttid	Ankomst topp	Kommentar

# 06:30	ca. 11:00	Perfekt for kjølig, klar luft – og du unngår både varme og evt. tordenvær/tåke

# 07:00	ca. 11:30	Også trygt – fortsatt god margin til endringer i været

# 08:00+	ca. 12:30+	Kan bli varmt, sterk sol og større sjanse for ettermiddagsvær/skyer

# 📈 Eksempel – normal marsjfart (Napoleonsruten):

# Orisson (liten hytte/kafé etter 8 km): etter ca. 2–2,5 timer

# 

# Toppen (Col de Lepoeder): etter ca. 4,5–5,5 timer

# 

# Roncesvalles: etter ca. 7–8,5 timer totalt

# 

# 🧠 Tips:

# Start mellom 06:30–07:00 for best opplevelse:

# 

# Morgendis og lav sol gir nydelige omgivelser

# 

# Mindre folk i stien

# 

# Du får bedre tid til pauser og fotografering

# 

# Ta en lang pause i Orisson (hvis åpen) for å spise og nyte utsikten

# 

# ☀️ Soloppgang og temperatur i midten av september:

# Soloppgang i SJPdP: ca. 07:30

# 

# Det vil være gryende dagslys fra 07:00, og det er trygt å starte da (eller litt før med hodelykt)

# 

# Konklusjon:

# ⏰ Start kl. 06:30–07:00 for å sikre både:

# 

# god temperatur i stigning

# 

# trygghet ved evt. værskifte

# 

# roligere og vakrere vandreopplevelse

# 

# Ønsker du et personlig tidsskjema for hele etappen (inkl. pauser og tempojustering)?

# 

# You said:

# Det går helt fint med varme, så lenge jeg slipper den største kulden. Ønsker å pakke minst mulig klær. Når på dagen bør jeg begynne? Er det andre etapper jeg skal være bekymret for kulde?

# ChatGPT said:

# Takk – da tilpasser vi anbefalingene til deg som helst vil unngå kulde, tåler varme godt, og ønsker å pakke minimalistisk.

# 

# 🎯 Mål: Unngå kulde – aksepter litt varme

# Da bør du starte litt senere enn vanlig første dag, slik at du går oppover i stigende temperatur, men fortsatt rekker over fjellet før ettermiddagsværet slår til.

# 

# 📍 Dag 1 – SJPdP til Roncesvalles

# Tidspunkt	Fordeler	Ulemper

# 06:30–07:00	Kjølig, god margin for vær	Kald start, spesielt over 800 moh

# 07:30–08:00	☀️ Bedre temperatur oppover	Fortsatt trygt mtp. torden/regn

# 08:00–08:30 ✅	Best for deg som ønsker minst mulig kulde	Litt mer sol og varme, men fortsatt god sikkerhet

# 🔁 Konklusjon: Start ca. kl. 08:00 – det er lys nok, behagelig temperatur, og du rekker fint over med normalt tempo (ankomst Roncesvalles ca. 16:00).

# 

# 🧤 Er det andre kalde etapper på Camino Francés i sept/okt?

# Generelt nei – men noen få høydepunkter kan være småkjølige:

# 

# Etappe	Kommentar

# Dag 1 – Pyreneene	Klart kaldest, spesielt før kl. 09

# Cruz de Ferro (dag ~24)	Høyeste punkt på ruta (1500 moh), men kortvarig og sjelden kald i sept

# Galicia (siste uke)	Tåke og fukt om morgenen er vanlig, men temperaturen er ofte 10–18 °C

# 🔹 De fleste dagene etter Pyreneene ligger temperaturen mellom 12–26 °C på dagtid, og 8–14 °C om natta i september/oktober.

# 

# 🎒 Pakketips for minst mulig klær (men trygt):

# ✅ Ta med:

# 

# 1 teknisk t-skjorte + 1 langermet trøye (ull/fleece)

# 

# 1 lett vindtett jakke (helst med hette)

# 

# 1 tynn buff/lue (tar ingen plass)

# 

# 1 lett regnjakke (essensielt for Galicia)

# 

# 1 shorts og 1 turbukse (gjerne zip-off)

# 

# Ingen tykk dunjakke eller regnbukse nødvendig

# 

# 📌 Oppsummert:

# Start kl. 08:00 første dag, for varmest mulig stigning over fjellet

# 

# Etter dag 1 trenger du ikke være bekymret for kulde

# 

# Med godt vær og lett sekk kan du gå hele caminoen med 2 lag pluss lett jakke

# 

# Vil du ha forslag til full minimalistisk pakkeliste (under 6 kg) tilpasset din komfort og sesong?

# ChatGPT said:

# Ja, det er mulig og ofte smart å forhåndsbooke flybussen fra Bilbao flyplass til bussterminalen (Termibus), men det er ikke et must. Her er vurderingen:

# 

# 🚌 Flybuss fra Bilbao lufthavn til sentrum (Termibus/Intermodal)

# 

# Reisetid: 25–30 min

# 

# Første buss: ca. 06:15

# Du rekker lett bussen etter landing 10:05

# → Mest sannsynlig er du på Termibus innen 11:00–11:15

# 

# 💶 Pris

# €3 (kontant) eller med Barik-kort (lokalt reisekort).

# 

# Du kan kjøpe billett ombord (kontanter anbefales).

# 

# Forhåndsbestilling er ikke nødvendig, men praktisk hvis du vil slippe kontanter eller usikkerhet.

# 

# 📲 Bestille på nett?

# Det er ikke vanlig med nettbestilling av A3247, men noen reiseapper (f.eks. Omio) kan ha billett, ellers:

# 

# Alternativ: Du kan forhåndskjøpe Barik-kort i automater eller kiosker på flyplassen og bruke det både til buss, metro og tog i Bilbao.

# 

# Barik gir litt rabatt per tur, men krever fysisk kort.

# 

# ✅ Anbefaling:

# Forhåndsbooking ikke nødvendig. Bare sørg for å ha:

# 

# €3 i småpenger

# 

# Eventuelt tid til å kjøpe Barik-kort

# 

# Spar deg for stress – bare følg skiltene til flybussen (A3247) etter landing.

# ✈️ Du lander i Bilbao kl. 10:05 (AM) 13. september.

# 

# 🚌 Da rekker du fint bussen fra Bilbao busstasjon (Termibus) kl. 11:55 AM til Bayonne (ankomst 14:20).

# 

# PM-alternativet (23:00) er sent på kvelden og lite gunstig med tanke på videre reise eller overnatting.

# 

# ✅ Oppsummering:

# 

# Bestill buss 11:55 AM, ikke PM.

# 

# Du rekker den komfortabelt med 1–1,5 time margin fra flyplassen til busstasjonen.

# 

# Ønsker du at jeg finner direkte lenke til å kjøpe den aktuelle billetten for 11:55 AM nå?

# Er det ikke like raskt med buss hele veien? Kan du gi meg to spesifikke linker om det klaffer med overganger

# ChatGPT said:

# Det finnes dessverre ingen direkte buss hele veien fra Bilbao til Saint‑Jean‑Pied‑de‑Port med kun én transport, men det finnes en fleksibel og prisgunstig løsning med buss og tog som passer godt med dine ankomsttider. Her er to anbefalte alternativer som begge klaffer med overgangene dine:

#

# 

# Her er vurderingen i detalj:

# 

# ✈️ Flyankomst

# Dato: Lørdag 13. september 2025

# 

# Ankomst: 07:50 til Bilbao Airport (BIO)

# 

# Typisk passkontroll og bagasje: ~30–45 minutter

# 

# 🚍 Buss Bilbao → Bayonne

# Avgang: 09:35 eller 11:55 (begge BlaBlaCar Bus)

# 

# Varighet: ca. 2 t 25–40 min

# 

# Ankomst Bayonne:

# 

# 09:35-avgang = ankomst 12:15

# 

# 11:55-avgang = ankomst 14:20 ❗ (for sent til 14:30-toget!)

# 

# ✅ Du bør ta bussen kl. 09:35, som du rekker komfortabelt om du tar taxi eller direkte flybuss fra flyplassen før kl. 09:00.

# 

# 📍 Avstand mellom bussholdeplass og togstasjon i Bayonne

# Stasjoner:

# 

# Buss: Gare Routière / Bayonne Central Bus Station

# 

# Tog: Bayonne Gare SNCF (main station)

# 

# Avstand: 1–2 minutters gangavstand

# Hvordan skal jeg rekker buss kl 09:35 når flyet mitt lander kl 10:05? Bussen min ankommer Bayonne kl 14:20. Hva alternativer har jeg, alternativt må jeg endre bilett?

# ChatGPT said:

# Du har helt rett – du rekker ikke bussen kl. 09:35 når flyet ditt lander kl. 10:05 i Bilbao. Du har allerede booket bussen som går kl. 11:55, som ankommer Bayonne kl. 14:20 – og det er for sent til toget kl. 14:30 videre til Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port.

# 

# 🔁 Alternativer nå:

# A) Endre busstiden (anbefalt hvis mulig)

# Sjekk om du kan endre til BlaBlaCar-bussen kl. 09:35, men du må da endre flyet til et tidligere ankommet (f.eks. kvelden før).

# 

# BlaBlaCar Bus-billetter kan noen ganger endres via app/nettside. Sjekk under "Your rides" > "Manage booking" eller kontakt kundeservice.

# 

# B) Ta senere tog til Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port

# 🚆 Tog fra Bayonne til Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port:

# 

# Avgang Bayonne	Ankomst SJPdP	Togtype

# 18:30	20:21	TER

# 🟢 Du rekker denne uten problem med bussen du har booket (ankomst 14:20), og da har du til og med tid til mat eller hvile i Bayonne.

# 

# C) Buss/taxi fra Bayonne til SJPdP

# Hvis du ikke vil vente, kan du vurdere:

# 

# Taxi: Ca. €100–€120 (1 t 15 min)

# 

# Blablacar (samkjøring): Sjekk appen for eventuelle ledige turer Bayonne → Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port den dagen

# 

# ✅ Anbefalt løsning:

# Ta det senere toget kl. 18:30 fra Bayonne til Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port. Kjøp billett her:

# 🔗 SNCF Connect – Bayonne til SJPdP

# 

# Pris: ca. €10–12

# 

# Sette opp endelig reiserute i nytt oversiktlig format

# 

# Vil du at jeg skal sjekke om det finnes tidligere fly til Bilbao 13. september – slik at du kan rekke 09:35-bussen og få en tidligere ankomst til fjellet?

# 

# You said:

# Jeg ankommer Bayonne 14:20. Er det mulighet å rekke 14:20 toget videre? Er togbilletter fleksible så jeg kan prøve å rekke det, hvis ikke ta 18:30 toget?

# ChatGPT said:

# Toget som går fra Bayonne kl. 14:30 til Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port kan i teorien være mulig å rekke, siden du ankommer med buss kl. 14:20 – men det er ekstremt risikabelt, og her er hvorfor:

# 

# ⏱ Tidsbuffer:

# Buss ankommer Bayonne busstasjon kl. 14:20

# 

# Toget går 10 minutter senere, kl. 14:30

# 

# Avstand til togstasjonen: Bayonne busstasjon og togstasjon er rett ved siden av hverandre (2–4 minutters gange), så det er fysisk mulig å nå toget på 5–7 minutter hvis alt klaffer.

# 

# ⚠️ Men… risiko:

# Buss kan bli forsinket, f.eks. 5–15 minutter – da er toget tapt.

# 

# Toget går presist, og dørene stenger før avgang, så det er ikke rom for å komme løpende 14:29.

# 

# Hvis du ikke har billett på forhånd, risikerer du å ikke rekke å kjøpe før toget går (selv på automat eller app).

# 

# 🎫 Er billetter fleksible?

# Ja og nei:

# 

# TER-tog (regionale tog), som denne ruten bruker, har som regel åpne billetter. Du kan ta et hvilket som helst tog samme dag på strekningen (hvis det er samme type billett).

# 

# Men: Det avhenger av hvordan du kjøper billetten:

# 

# Kjøpt i SNCF-automaten på stasjonen eller i appen med “libre circulation”, så kan du bruke den senere.

# 

# Kjøper du spesifikt for 14:30-toget på f.eks. SNCF Connect med lavpris, kan den være bundet til tidspunkt og ikke-refunderbar.

# 

# ✅ Anbefalt strategi:

# Kjøp billett til 14:30-toget, helst via SNCF Connect eller appen deres.

# 

# Velg fleksibel billett (TER, uten seteplassering)

# 

# Prøv å rekke 14:30-toget (det er fysisk mulig!)

# 

# Hvis du ikke rekker det, bruk samme billett på 18:30-avgangen

# 

# MEN: dobbelsjekk at billetten du kjøper er gyldig for begge tog (se etter "valid for all TER today" eller “sans réservation obligatoire”).

# 

# Togtider 13. september (Bayonne → Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port):

# 

# 🎫 Fleksibilitet og hva du bør gjøre:

# Kjøp en fleksibel TER-billett som gir deg mulighet til å ta senere avganger samme dag.

# 

# Da kan du forsøke å rekke 14:35-toget, i tilfelle busstiden stemte nøyaktig.

# Er det Central Station Bayonne jeg skal bytte fra buss til tog?

# ChatGPT said:

# Ja, det stemmer ✅ – BlablaCar Bus og SNCF TER-toget går begge fra det som kalles:

# 

# 📍 Bayonne – Gare SNCF

# Også kjent som:

# 

# Bayonne Central Station

# 

# Gare de Bayonne

# 

# Adresse: Place Pereire, 64100 Bayonne, France

# 

# Dette er hovedjernbanestasjonen i Bayonne, og den deler område med bussterminalen.

# 

# 🚏 Fra buss til tog – praktisk info

# Type	Ankomst / avgang	Sted

# BlablaCar Bus	Ankommer ca. kl. 14:20	Bayonne busstasjon (ved Gare SNCF)

# TER tog	Går f.eks. kl. 14:35 eller 18:20	Bayonne togstasjon (SNCF)

# Gangavstand mellom buss og tog: ca. 1–2 minutter (samme område, ingen taxi/trikk/buss nødvendig)

# 

# Skilt og perronger: Tydelig skiltet – se etter "TER" eller "Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port"

# 

# Det er et lite område, og du trenger ikke navigere gjennom en stor terminal

# 

# 🗺️ Se kart (Google Maps)

# 📍Bayonne Station – Gare SNCF

# 

# Du kan zoome inn for å se bussholdeplassene rett foran stasjonen.

# 

# ✅ Konklusjon:

# Ja – du ankommer og drar fra samme sted (Bayonne Gare SNCF). Du trenger ikke bytte stasjon, og du har 5–10 min gange maks fra buss til tog, om du er effektiv.

# 

# Vil du at jeg setter opp en konkret tidsplan med marginer, matpause og backup-plan?

# 

# You said:

# Er det kanskje et busstopp som korresponderer med toget tidligere så jeg kan spare tid?

# ChatGPT said:

# Flott spørsmål! Her er det du trenger å vite om muligheten for tidligere forbindelse mellom buss og tog i Bayonne, slik at du eventuelt kan spare tid og kanskje rekke et tidligere tog:

# 

# 🚏 Korrespondanse mellom bussholdeplass og togstasjon i Bayonne

# Busstoppet du ankommer med ligger ved Bayonne busstasjon (Place des Basques / Quai de Lesseps), som er direkte ved siden av Gare de Bayonne – den sentrale togstasjonen. Avstanden er kun 1–2 minutter til fots, og disse er i samme transitområde 

# Traveling.com

# .

# 

# 🔁 Finnes det alternative bussholdeplasser som gir deg earlier tog?

# Nei. De vanlige bussrutene fra Bilbao stopper alle ved den sentrale bussterminalen ved Gare de Bayonne, så du har ingen reell mulighet til å hoppe av på et annet stopp nærmere togplattformen for å spare tid 

# Rome2Rio

# Omio

# .

# 

# Denne terminalen fungerer også som inngang til togstasjonen – det er ikke flere alternative stopp som gir bedre timing.

# 

# 🕓 Togalternativer etter din ankomst (kl. 14:20 med buss)

# Raskeste tog etter ankomst kl. 14:20 går kl. ca. 14:20–14:24 (ikke 14:35). Dette har minimal margin, og krever at bussankomst er punktlig og du går rett til plattformen umiddelbart

# 

# Sikrere alternativ: bruk 18:20–18:37-toget, som du trygt rekker med stor margin. Krever ingen stress og samme billett er gyldig dersom den er åpen TER‑billett 

# Wikipedia

# Camino de Santiago

# .

# 

# ✅ Oppsummert:

# Det finnes ikke et alternativt busstopp som gir bedre timing – alle busser ankommer hovedterminalen ved Gare de Bayonne, rett ved togstasjonen.

# 

# Du har ingen sjanse til å hente et tidligere tog ved å velge et annet stopp – beste mulighet er enten 14:20-avgang (meget trang margin) eller 18:20-toget (mer komfort).

# 

# 🚩 Hva bør du gjøre videre?

# Hvis du ønsker trygghet:

# 

# Kjøp en fleksibel TER-billett (uten seteplass og gyldig hele dagen) Bayonne → Saint‑Jean-Pied‑de‑Port.

# 

# Forsøk å rekke 14:20-toget (kun 1–2 min fra holdeplass til tog) dersom alt går presist.

# 

# Hvis du blir forsinket med buss, bruk 18:20-avgangen uten ekstra kostnad.

# You said:

# Da regner jeg med togbiletten TER kl 14:20 er fleksibel samme dag. Men siden jeg skal ha flaks for å rekke det, er det en ide å bestille TER biletten til kl 18:20? Regner med den i så tilfelle kan brukes på 14:20 tog, hvis jeg er heldig med transit. På den måten helgarderer jeg meg?

# ChatGPT said:

# Ja – det er en smart og trygg strategi å kjøpe TER-billetten til kl. 18:20, og likevel forsøke å rekke 14:20-toget hvis alt klaffer.

# 

# Her er hvorfor dette fungerer:

# 

# ✅ TER-billetter (Train Express Régional – SNCF)

# Ingen plassreservasjon: TER-billetter gjelder hele dagen for den valgte strekningen, uavhengig av tidspunktet du velger under kjøp.

# 

# Fleksibel bruk: Du kan bruke billetten på et hvilket som helst TER-tog samme dag, så lenge det er på den ruten du har kjøpt (Bayonne → Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port).

# 

# Ingen ombooking nødvendig: Om du rekker det tidligere toget, er det bare å gå rett på – billetten skannes ombord eller på plattform.

# 

# 🎯 Anbefalt strategi:

# Handling	Effekt

# Kjøp TER-billett til 18:20	Du har en garantert plass senere på dagen

# Prøv å rekke 14:20-toget	Hvis du kommer deg raskt av bussen (14:20 ankomst), kan du hoppe rett på

# Ingen ekstra kostnad	Du trenger ikke kjøpe ny billett om du bruker den tidligere avgangen

# 📍 Kjøpslenke:

# Du kan kjøpe fleksibel billett på:

# (Søk: Bayonne → Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port, dato: 13. september, velg f.eks. 18:20 som "formell" avgang)

# 

# Se etter "TER NA L54". Den gjelder alle avganger den dagen.

# 

# 🔐 Helgardering med ro i magen:

# Dette gir deg trygghet ved forsinkelse – og fleksibilitet ved flaks. Smart valg.
